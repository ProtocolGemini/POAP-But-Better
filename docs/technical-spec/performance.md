# Performance Requirements

## Load Handling
- Support for 100,000+ concurrent users
- 99.99% uptime SLA
- < 100ms API response time
- Auto-scaling triggers at 70% CPU

## Storage Requirements
1. **Database Sizing**
   - Initial: 500GB
   - Growth: 50GB/month
   - Backup retention: 30 days

2. **File Storage**
   - Collectible assets: 10TB
   - User uploads: 5TB
   - CDN caching: 1TB

## Monitoring
```typescript
interface PerformanceMetrics {
  responseTime: number;
  errorRate: number;
  userConcurrency: number;
  resourceUtilization: {
    cpu: number;
    memory: number;
    storage: number;
  };
}
```

## Testing Strategy
1. **Load Testing**
   - K6 for performance testing
   - JMeter for stress testing
   - Continuous performance monitoring
   - Automated scaling tests

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Jest for unit tests
   - Cypress for E2E testing
   - API contract testing
   - Security scanning
