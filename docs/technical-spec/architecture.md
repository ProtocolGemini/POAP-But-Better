# Core Platform Architecture

## Overview
The platform follows a modern, scalable microservices architecture with the following key components:

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, Zustand for client state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Package Manager**: pnpm for efficient dependency management
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express
- **API Design**: REST for general operations, GraphQL for complex data queries
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh token rotation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data, Redis for caching
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 for collectible assets
- **Search**: Elasticsearch for advanced collectible search

### Infrastructure
- **Deployment**: Docker containers orchestrated with Kubernetes
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- **Monitoring**: Datadog for application and infrastructure monitoring
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

## Security Measures
1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

2. **Data Protection**
   - AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
   - TLS 1.3 for all API communications
   - Regular security audits and penetration testing

3. **API Security**
   - Rate limiting
   - Request validation
   - CORS policies
   - API key management

## Scalability Considerations
1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Stateless application design
   - Load balancing with AWS ALB
   - Auto-scaling groups

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - CDN integration for static assets
   - Database query optimization
   - Caching strategies at multiple levels
